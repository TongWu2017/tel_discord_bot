# tel
Tel is a Discord bot I created to help me and my friends on Discord, to learn more about programming, and most importantly, to have fun.
A few npm packages are needed to use this bot, which can be installed with the command `npm install <package name>`. It includes discord.js, node-fetch@2, jssoup, cheerio, and html-to-text.
To use this bot: create a file `token.txt` and put the bot token inside the file.
This is my first project to upload to GitHub. I apologize if anything does not work. Feel free to let me know if anything does not work.
