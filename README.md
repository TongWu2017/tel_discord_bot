# tel
Tel is a Discord bot I created to help me and my friends on Discord, to learn more about programming, and most importantly, to have fun.
A few npm packages are needed to use this bot, which can be installed with the command `npm install <package name>`. It includes discord.js, node-fetch@2, jssoup, cheerio, and html-to-text.
To use this bot: create a file `token.txt` and put the bot token inside the file.

Originally, this project was developed locally. Only part of it is uploaded to GitHub. However, I will ensure that the uploaded parts work with each other, while also working with the latest version of discord.js
